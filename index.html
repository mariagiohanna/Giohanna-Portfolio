        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi there! üñêÔ∏è <br /><br />

          I'm a mechatronics engineer with a minor in AI and Database, graduated
          from the School of Engineering at the Asuncion National University
          (Dec 2022), from Paraguay. <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p class="WebsiteOnly">
          üìö I participated in the Erasmus+ program for academic mobility at the
          Complutense University of Madrid, Spain (2020). There I studied
          electronics engineering, taking radiofrecuency, control systems,
          robotics and others courses. I was volunteering in the Po Paraguay
          organization, developing a low-cost electronic prosthesis with 3D
          printing (2021). <br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          üíª Currently, I am working as Backend Developer at
          <a href="https://www.airnguru.com/">Airnguru</a>, where we produce
          pricing intelligence technology for helping airlines optimize fare
          structures. <br />
        </p>
        <p class="WebsiteOnly">
          <br />
          And I am also collaborating with the Computer Science and Mathematics
          Research group at FP-UNA, developing models to predict dengue cases by
          applying machine learning techniques. And in the future, I would like
          to expand my area of expertise to the Big Data and Cloud Computing
          industry. ü¶æ I have a passion for developing ML models that will help
          to gain insight from data. My biggest strengths are python
          programming, data visualization, critical thinking, effective
          communication and research.

      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Here, in Paraguay, we have two official languages: spanish and guarani.
        On dailybase we hear and speak jopara, which is a mix of our both
        languages.
        <br /><br />
        I also speak portuguese. I did some exchanges programs in Brazil, where
        I could practice it.
        <br /><br />
        I speak english, and I have a few well-crafted English research article.
        Feel free to ask for them.
        <br /><br />
        Currently, I am learning german so I speak ein bisschen of it.
